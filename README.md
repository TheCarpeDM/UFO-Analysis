# UFO-Analysis

## Purpose
Our goal was to update Dana's webpage to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The site now allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time including: date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

To perform a search, simply scroll down to the search fields:
![Search Fields Left side of page](../static/images/SearchFields.png)

Click on any of the fields, type your search term in, and either use the "Tab" key or click on a different field to start your search!

## Summary

One major drawback of this site is that the data does not update automatically over time, so users will always be analyzing and sorting through old data. This could be addressed by finding a dataset that is updated regularly and use the site to consider that data rather than the limited set we started with. The search could also be clearer if the fields provided more information about how to search since searching is not case sensitive, nor does it connect "canada" to "ca" for instance.
